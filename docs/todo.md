# Project TODO

## High Priority

- [ ] Replace placeholder organization details in `OrganizationJsonLd` with real Umbraco data or environment-driven configuration.
- [ ] Add JSON-LD coverage for additional templates (e.g. Article, Service) once content models are available.
- [ ] Document a quick Rich Results testing walkthrough so QA can validate structured data updates.

## Analytics Follow-Ups

- [ ] Reconcile the Phase 3 instrumentation checklist with the current implementation and tick off completed items in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- [ ] Evaluate whether additional automated analytics tests are needed beyond `docs/phase-3-analytics-qa.md`.

## Operational

- [ ] Capture the exact steps to launch the project locally so the "Launch the Project" checklist item can be marked complete.
